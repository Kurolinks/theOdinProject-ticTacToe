// 1. Store gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object

// 2. Players stored in classes

// 3. Object for flow of game

// 4. Tuck as much inside factories, only reduce global codes

// 5.If you need only an instance of something, wrap the factory inside an IIFE

// 6. Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard Objects. Put them in a logical place.

// New List
// 1. Create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic
// 2. Write a function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage
// 3. Write functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elemdnts

// 4. Ouch! e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker). Donâ€™t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!

// 5. Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!
